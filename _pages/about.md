Before joining the faculty at UC Berkeley, Prof. Ranade was a Researcher at Microsoft Research AI in the Adaptive Systems and Interaction Group. She also designed and taught the first offering for the new course sequence EECS16A and EECS16B in the EECS department at UC Berkeley and received the 2017 UC Berkeley Electrical Engineering Award for Outstanding Teaching. She was also awarded the 2020 UC Berkeley award for Extraordinary Teaching in Extraordinary Times. Prof. Ranade received her PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley, and her undergraduate degree from MIT in Cambridge, MA.

# Selected Experience

## ü§ñ Open Source Contributions
I have experience contributing to [Arena Bench](https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav) a large open-source project for robotic obstacle avoidance using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Moreover, I have published a [respective paper](https://sudo-boris.github.io/publication/2022-Arena-Bench) at the IROS conference and in the Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) journal.

## üìú Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).

## üë®üèª‚Äçüî¨ Professional Experience
Currently I am working as a **Student Researcher** at the Reliable Multimodal AI Lab at the TU Darmstadt under the supervision of Prof. Marcus Rohrbach working on **Generative Video-Language Modelling**.
Additionally, I have professional experience working as an **Applied Machine Learning Student Researcher** at the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute. \
There I worked on dynamic traffic flow forecasting using Graph Neural Networks.

## üìö Teaching and Community Contributions
To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@borismeinardus) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@boris.meinardus) channel where I publish educational Machine Learning content.
