# Additional Information


-I'm one of the co-chairs of the Women in Information Theory (WITHITS), come to one of our events!

-As a graduate student I was heavily involved with the Electrical Engineering Graduate Student Association (EEGSA) and Women in Computer Science and Engineering (WICSE) at Berkeley. I also co-founded EECSPeers, a peer-support community. Working with these organizations was one of the highlights of my graduate experience , do get involved if you can.

-In 2009, I was one of the first instructors at the Meltwater Entreprenurial School of Technology in Accra, Ghana where I designed and taught introductory computer science classes.

-Consider teaching with the Prison University Project if you are in the Bay Area, I had a very impactful and fun experience teaching here when I was a graduate student.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).

-As an undergrad at MIT, I had a ton of fun being involved in Dramashop (Our Town, Imperceptible Mutabilities in the Third Kingdom), The Tech (my article about the blaster worm made it to Slashdot, before I even knew what Slashdot was), and doing research in the Computational Physiology and Clinical Inference Group.

-I owe a lot to M. Prakash Sir and the Bhaskaracharya Pratishthan in Pune, India for helping me see the beauty of mathematics. Thank you to him and so many more of my teachers who helped me become who I am.
