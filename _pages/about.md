Before joining the faculty at UC Berkeley, Prof. Ranade was a Researcher at [Microsoft Research AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-ai/) in the [Adaptive Systems and Interaction Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/adaptive-systems-and-interaction/). She also designed and taught the first offering for the new course sequence [EECS16A](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee16a/sp15) and [EECS16B](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee16b/fa15) in the EECS department at UC Berkeley and received the 2017 UC Berkeley Electrical Engineering Award for Outstanding Teaching. She was also awarded the 2020 UC Berkeley award for Extraordinary Teaching in Extraordinary Times. Prof. Ranade received her PhD in [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](http://eecs.berkeley.edu/) from the [University of California, Berkeley](http://berkeley.edu/), and her undergraduate degree from [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/) in Cambridge, MA.

# Additional Information


- I'm one of the co-chairs of the [Women in Information Theory (WITHITS)](https://www.itsoc.org/withits), come to one of our events!

- As a graduate student I was heavily involved with the [Electrical Engineering Graduate Student Association (EEGSA)](http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~eegsa/wiki/doku.php) and [Women in Computer Science and Engineering (WICSE)](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wicse/) at Berkeley. I also co-founded [EECSPeers](http://eecs.berkeley.edu/eecs-peers/), a peer-support community. Working with these organizations was one of the highlights of my graduate experience , do get involved if you can.

- If you are an undergrad in EECS at Berkeley (or anywhere else), get involved in research. Present your work at the [Undergraduate Research Symposium!](https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Diversity/springsymposium.html)

- In 2009, I was one of the first instructors at the [Meltwater Entreprenurial School of Technology](http://meltwater.org/) in Accra, Ghana where I designed and taught introductory computer science classes.

- Consider teaching with the [Prison University Project](http://www.prisonuniversityproject.org/) if you are in the Bay Area, I had a very impactful and fun experience teaching here when I was a graduate student.

- As an undergrad at MIT, I had a ton of fun being involved in Dramashop ([Our Town](http://web.mit.edu/jscheib/www/ourtown/fotos.html), Imperceptible Mutabilities in the Third Kingdom), The Tech (my article about the [blaster worm](http://tech.mit.edu/V123/N39/39SoBig2.39n.html) made it to [Slashdot](https://slashdot.org/), before I even knew what Slashdot was), and doing research in the [Computational Physiology and Clinical Inference Group](https://www.rle.mit.edu/cpci/).

- I owe a lot to M. Prakash Sir and the [Bhaskaracharya Pratishthan](https://www.bprim.org/) in Pune, India for helping me see the beauty of mathematics. Thank you to him and so many more of my teachers who helped me become who I am.
